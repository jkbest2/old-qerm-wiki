=== Farro and Garbanzo Bean Soup ===

'''Ingredients''' (Feeds 12ish)

* 16 oz [[Wikipedia: Emmer | Farro]] in whole grains (found at Whole Foods)
* 15 oz canned Garbanzo Beans 
* 6 cloves Garlic
* 1 rnd Leek
* 28 oz canned chopped Tomatoes
* 2 Yellow Potatoes
* 2 Sweet Onions 
* 8 cups Veggie Broth
* Assortment of veggies (1 cup mushrooms; 1/2 cup carrots; some fresh basil)
* Spices (whatever to suit the taste)
* Pecorino Toscano cheese for garnish

'''Instructions'''

# Rinse the farro in several changes of water, removing impurities and chaff as needed. Let them soak for a few hours (8 seems to be traditional). Drain garbanzo beans. Chop veggies into bite-sized pieces.
# In a large pot, heat oil on medium heat. Add onion, garlic, leek and cook till onions are golden. Add the tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, basil and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the broth, bring to a boil. Then reduce heat to low and add the farro and the garbanzo beans till the farro is tender and chewy (about 30 min). Add the mushrooms near the end. Season to taste. Garnish with cheese.

^^ make sure to get [[Wikipedia: Emmer | farro (''Triticum dicoccum'')]], and not something similar like barley or spelt. Cooking times will change and the latter grains aren't as chewy or nutritious.

=== Vegetarian French Onion Soup ===

'''Ingredients''' (Feeds 10ish)

* 3+ lbs sweet onions (more the merrier; I used about 13)
* 8 cups veggie broth
* 6 tbsp margarine
* 5 cloves garlic
* 1/2 cup flour
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 1/2 cup sherry (or white wine)
* Spices (whatever to suit the taste; commonly: dried mustard, thyme, oregano)
* Gruyere cheese for garnish
* 1/2 packet of dried shiitake mushrooms
* 12 oz firm tofu

'''Instructions'''

# Quickly and thinly slice all onions before the eyes swell up. Add some salt to the onions to extract even more flavor. Heat up a large pot with olive oil and saute the onions. After the onions turn slightly golden, melt the margarine and add garlic; Stir to coat the onions till they are caramelized (about 45 min total). Meanwhile, soak the shiitake mushrooms in water.
# Once the onions are ready, add the flour to create the rue. Now add the sherry and bring it up to a boil. After about 5 to 10 min, add the veggie broth and bay leaves. Lower heat and simmer till the onion flavor dominates the veggie broth (about 30 min). Cut out the stem of the hydrated shiitake mushroom before thinly slicing. Cut the tofu in bite sized pieces and haul it in to the soup alongside the mushrooms. Make sure to include the shiitake juice in the soup as well. Season to taste.
# Let sit overnight to really extract the flavor. Garnish with Gruyere cheese. Even better, "gratinize" the soup and serve with French bread.

=== Khichri ===

(Plagiarized from: http://www.mamtaskitchen.com/recipe_display.php?id=10041)


Ingredients
* 250 gm. rice, 
* 150 gm. moong split green gram lentil) or urad/urd/urid dal or black gram lentil, with skin. Ordinary red lentil will also do.
* 1-2 tbs. cooking oil of choice
* 1 tsp. cumin seeds
* A pinch of asafetida (heeng) optional. It is good for digestion.
* 1/2 tsp. turmeric powder (optional). Turmeric is good for healing.
* Salt to taste
* Water, twice in volume to the rice and lentil mix. See step 8
* Optional:
* Chilli powder or 1 chopped green chilli
* 1 onion - peeled and sliced.
* A cup of peas
* A few florets of cauliflower
* 1 tbs. olive or other oil

Instructions
# Clean, wash and drain dal and rice together.
# Boil water in kettle or a separate pan.
# Heat oil in a pressure cooker or a pan with a tight lid.
# Add cumin seeds and asafoetida and wait until seeds sputter, not letting them burn.
# Add onions, if used, and fry until golden brown. If using any other vegetables, add here.
# Add rice-dal mix and stir fry for a couple of minutes. This will coat the rice and dal grains with oil.
# Add salt and turmeric and give it a quick stir.
# Add enough boiling water to cover the rice, and 1/2 inch above it (1 1/2 inch, if not using pressure cooker).
# Bring to a brisk boil, pressure cook for 2-3 whistles or pressures*. If cooking in a pan, cover and simmer gently on a low fire, until almost all water is absorbed and rice and dal are tender.

Notes
# When the pressure builds up in a pressure cooker, the steam escapes with a hiss, letting the pressure down. This counts as one whistle or pressure. Pressure builds up again and the same thing happens again and again, until you switch the heat off. In India, people usually count the number of times this happens and call them pressures or whistle. If you find it difficult to follow, for green gram/moong dal, cook for 3-4 minutes under pressure. For black gram dal/urad/urid dal, cook for 5-6 minutes, because it takes a bit longer to cook.
# A tsp. of ghee on top of the khichri before serving gives it an authentic flavour
# You can add a 1/4 tsp. of garam masala, along with salt and turmeric, at step 7.
# Experiment with adding other vegetables.

=== Red Lentil Soup with Lemon  ===
served by Eileen on Oct. 30, 2008

[[Image:Hot-soup-poster.jpg]]

''Borrowed from the New York Times, January 8, 2008''

Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, more for drizzling
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* Pinch of ground chili powder or cayenne, more to taste
* 1 quart vegetable broth
* 1 cup red lentils
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
* Juice of 1/2 lemon, more to taste
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Instructions
# After checking a few local grocery stores for red lentils and realizing they're very special, call the PCC and get them to save the last 1.5 lbs of bulk red lentils for you until you can get there. (Or go to the local Indian grocery store. Personal Recommendation: R&amp;M grocery, on 55th and the Ave, on the west side of the street has an excellent dal (lentil) collection, and a very sweet old gentleman that keeps the store.)
# In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high heat until hot and simmering.  Add onion and garlic, then some extra garlic for kicks, and saute until golden, about 4 minutes.
# Stir in tomato paste, cumin, pepper and chili powder or cayenne, and saute for 2 minutes longer.
# Add broth, 2 cups water, lentils and carrot.  Bring to a simmer, then partially cover pot and turn heat to medium-low.  Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 minutes.  Taste and add salt if necessary.
# Puree half the soup, then add it back to the pot.  Soup should be somewhat chunky.
# Reheat the soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro.

Makes 4 servings.

=== Greek Lentil === 
'''([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faki_soupa ''Φακές σούπα''])'''

''from [http://www.amazon.com/222-Recipes-Greek-Cookery-Book/dp/9605400316 222 Recipes, The Greek Cookery Book] by Sofia Souli''

1 portion, calories: 430. Cooking time: 20-30 minutes. Portions: 4-6.

* 1/2 kilo of lengtils
* 1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped
* 8 cloves of garlic
* 1 cup of oil (this is crazy, 1/3 cup of olive oil is more like it--still plenty oily)
* 4-5 tablespoonfuls of vinegar
* 1 cup of tomato juice (or canned tomato or whatever form you like)
* 5 bay leaves
* salt, pepper

Pick over the lentils very carefully, making sure that all foreign bodies and bad lentils are removed and thrown away before washing. (Maybe the Greeks have lots of foreign bodies and bad lentils, but the here in the good old U. S. of A., we keep them foreign bodies out of our good old home-grown ''lentilles vertes du Puy''). Wash them well. Put lentils in a saucepan and cover with water. Allow to boil for 5 minutes and then strain. Put the lentils back into the saucepan with the onion, the oil, the tomato juice, the garlic and the bay leaves. Also add the vinegar and, finally, the salt and the pepper. Supplement with water according to preferred thickness of soup and allow the ingredients to boil till tender.

=== Tomato bisque === 
served by Liz on Oct. 2, 2008

''Inspired by the contents of my cupboard one night''

''I like to call it Two Can soup, but this seems to conjure up images of something non-vegetarian''

1 portion, calories: does it matter? Cooking time: 20-30 minutes. Portions: 2-3.

* 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
* 1 can stewed tomatoes
* 1 can garbanzo beans
* options: carrot, celery
* 1 pint cream
* 3 T dill
* 1 clove of garlic, crushed into very small pieces
* salt &amp; pepper to taste

In a medium pot, heat up the onions in a bit of oil until they become translucent. Add the tomatoes and garbanzos, and turn the heat down to medium. You can add either of the options at this point, if you happen to find them sitting around in your frig. When the everything seems well-cooked to the point of starting to be mushy, add dill and remove pot from heat. Blend well; I prefer a hand buzzer, but I guess a normal blender would work too. Put pot back over low heat, and cook ~5 min. Remove from heat, add cream and crushed garlic (it'll cook since the soup is hot). Salt and pepper to your individual taste. I like this soup with a grilled cheese sandwich.

=== Carrot Ginger Soup === 

''adapted from [http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Foods-Market-Cookbook/dp/0609806440 The Whole Foods Market Cookbook]''

Portions: 6-8.

* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 4 medium onions, sliced
* 1 (3-inch) piece of fresh ginger
* 5 cups of vegetable stock
* 1 cup of orange juice
* 8 large carrots, roughly cut in evenly sized pieces
* 2 teaspoon of salt
* 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper

Heat the canola oil in a large sauce pot over low heat, and sauté the onions until they are translucent.  Cut the peeled ginger into 1-inch slices and then roughly chop.  Add the chopped ginger to the onions, and sauté for an additional 2 minutes.  Increase heat.  Add the stock, orange juice and carrots.  Simmer over medium heat until the carrots are tender.  Season with salt and pepper.  Puréé. Enjoy.


=== Shiitake Mushroom Soup w/ Quinoa ===

Served by Motoki on Jan 14, 2009.

'''Ingredients'''(Feeds 12ish)

* 3 cups of quinoa grains
* a liberal use (2 packets) of dried shiitake mushrooms (thick whole ones)
* 2 onions
* 5 cloves of garlic
* misc vegetables (2 stalks of celery, 1 bok-choy)
* 1 packet of soybeans
* 3 teaspoons of thyme
* a few tablespoons of soy sauce + salt to taste
* 1 cup of sake

'''Instructions'''

Cook the soybeans (if raw) beforehand as they take 3~4 hours to get done (or use canned beans for convenience). Boil a pot 3/4 full of water, and haul in the dried shiitake mushrooms. While the shiitake are soaking in hot water, chop onions and garlic into small pieces and mix them together with a little salt in a bowl. Put these in the pot with the sake after about 30 minutes. In another pot with boiling water, insert the quinoa at a 2:1 ratio of water to grains and cover with medium heat for about 15 minutes till the water is all gone. Fluff it for another 15 by turning off the heat. Next, we can add the misc vegetables (post-chopping) and the cooked quinoa into the broth. Add soy sauce and salt for desired taste, and cook till desired consistency.

* margarine or oil (I used olive oil)
* salt and pepper
* fresh dates (optional)
* Ingredients I added based on different recipes: tablespoon-ish paprika, broken-up angel hair pasta


'''Instructions'''

# Start by putting the cooked chickpeas or lentils in a large saucepan. Add the shallots or onions, spices, tomato, and half the cilantro and parsley. Pour in the water or stock and add a blob of margarine or oil.
# Bring to boil, covered, and simmer gently to let the ingredients combine.
# After 15 minutes or so, remove a little of the cooking liquid and mix it in a small bowl containing the flour, to make a smooth paste. Return this to the stewpot and stir well to mix it in. Pour in lemon juice to taste and season.
# Contine to simmer for 5 minutes, adjust seasonings, and serve with the remaining parsley and cilantro/coriander on top. Serve with fresh dates, if possible.

'''Chilean pumpkin and cranberry bean stew'''

Served by [[User:Chloe | Chloe]] on March 4, 2009.

''Recipe adapted from [http://www.whats4eats.com/soups/porotos-granados-recipe Whats 4 Eats]: "The origins of Chile's porotos granados reach back into pre-Hispanic times. The basic ingredients--pumpkin, beans, corn and tomatoes--are all indigenous to the New World."''

[[Image:Porotosgranados.jpg| right ]] 

'''Ingredients'''
* Oil -- 3 tablespoons
* Onion, chopped -- 1
* Garlic, minced -- 2-3 cloves
* Paprika -- 1 tablespoons
* Ground cumin -- 1 teaspoon
* Oregano, dried -- 1 teaspoon
* Tomatoes, chopped -- 1 cup
* Stock or water -- 4 cups
* Butternut squash, peeled and chopped into chunks -- 1 to 1 1/2 pounds
* Cranberry beans, cooked and rinsed -- 2 cups
* Wild rice -- 1/3 cup
* Salt and pepper -- to taste
* Corn, fresh or frozen -- 1 cup

'''Instructions'''
# Bring the stock to a boil, add the wild rice, and cook for 40 minutes.
# Meanwhile, heat the oil over medium flame in a large pot. Add the onions and sauté until translucent. Stir in the garlic, paprika, cumin and oregano and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.
# Add onion mixture, tomatoes, squash, beans, salt and pepper. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is cooked through and soft.
# Stir in the corn. Simmer another 5 minutes, adjust seasoning and serve.

===Potato Chickpea and Leek===
'''Potato chickpea and leek soup'''

Served by [[User:Liz | Liz]] on March 11, 2009.

[[Image:chickpea&amp;lentil.jpg | right | 250px]]

''Recipe from a cookbook by Jaime Oliver''
Serves 6 (but only as an appetizer soup! I made 5 times the recipe for QERM soup)

'''Ingredients'''
* 12oz chickpeas, soaked overnight (I used canned beans)
* 1 medium potato, peeled and cut into pieces
* 5 medium leeks
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1-2 tablespoons butter
* 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced
* Salt and pepper
* 1 ½ pints chicken or vegetable stock (I used Rapunzel vegan veggie stock)
* Parmesan cheese, grated

'''Instructions'''
# Cook the garbanzo beans and the potato until tender.
# Remove the outer skin of the leeks, slice lengthways from the root up, wash carefully and slice finely.
# Warm a thick bottomed pan, and add the tablespoon of oil and the butter.  Add the leeks and garlic to the pan, and sweat gently with a good pinch of salt until tender and sweet.  Add the drained chickpeas and potato and cook for 1 minute.  Add about two-thirds of the stock and simmer for 15 minutes.
# Now decide if you want to puree the soup in some sort of processor, or leave it chunky and brothy, or do what I do which is puree half and leave the other half whole—this gives a lovely smooth comforting feel but also keeps a bit of texture.  Now add enough of the remaining stock to achieve the consistency you like.  Check for seasoning, and add parmesan to taste to round off the flavors.  Top off with a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil, a grinding of black pepper and an extra sprinkling of parmesan.

Served by [[User:Aditya.khanna | Aditya]] on 15 April, 2009.

Ingredients
* 2 cups red and yellow lentils
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons curry paste
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon chili powder

[[Image:gj.jpg| right | 100px | dessert]] 
[[Image:rg.jpg| right | 100px | dessert]]

'''Instructions'''

# Wash the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear (this is very important or the lentils will get "scummy"), put the lentils in a pot with water to cover and simmer covered until lentils tender (add more water if necessary).
# While the lentils are cooking: In a large skillet or saucepan, caramelize the onions in vegetable oil.
# While the onions are cooking, combine the curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder, salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a mixing bowl. Mix well. When the onions are cooked, add the curry mixture to the onions and cook over a high heat stirring constantly for 1 to 2 minutes.
# Stir in the tomato puree and reduce heat, allow the curry base to simmer until the lentils are ready.
# When the lentils are tender drain them briefly (they should have absorbed most of the water but you don't want the curry to be too sloppy). Mix the curry base into the lentils and serve immediately.




=== African peanut soup ===
[[Image:Africanpeanutsoup.JPG | 250px]]

This recipe is originally from Bellingham's Colophon Cafe. The version below has been modified by me.
served by [[User:Ian|Ian]] on May 6, 2009 and Nov. 10, 2004, and maybe sometime in 2002 as well. For QERM, I trippled the recipe below.

'''BLEND IN FOOD PROCESSOR'''
* 1 oz ginger root--scrubbed/chunkd
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 t chili pepper flakes

'''HEAT ON STOVE'''
* 1+ T red palm oil
* 1+ T flour, stirred constantly to make a roux
* 1 onion, chopped fine, fried in the roux for a bit
* 1/2 lb peanuts, dry roasted, unsalted, chopped up in food processor
* 1 big can (28oz) or more of diced tomatoes
* some liquid (I added a veggie bullion)
* the blended stuff from above

Boil for a while (1 hour plus), adding more liquid as needed

=== Cream of Chili soup ===
[[Image:poblano-hot-chili.JPG | right | 170px]]

Served by [[User:Liz.atwood|Liz]] on June 3, 2009.

This soup was inspired by a great mom and pop restaurant in Pescadero, CA, called [http://www.duartestavern.com/ Duarte's]if you are ever driving up from Santa Cruz to San Francisco along Hwy 1. I made 4 times the recipe for the QERM soup.

'''Ingredients'''
* 4 peppers (depending on your spiciness tastes, I used half green peppers and half pasilla peppers for QERM)
* ½ cup rice
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 cloves garlic, finely sliced
* Salt and pepper
* 1 ½ pints chicken or vegetable stock (I used Rapunzel vegan veggie stock)
* dollop of heavy cream

'''Instructions'''
# Half and deseed chiles, and place them under a broiler until the skin is blackened and separated from the flesh. Take them out of the oven, peel off the skin, dice and the leave to the side. Keep as much of the juices as you can.
# Heat oil and diced onions in a pot till onions are translucent. Add rice and then the stock. Let boil till rice is tender.
# Throw in diced chiles, and simmer for another 10 min.
# Blend to make a nice consistency (yah for hand blenders), add crushed garlic while still hot, the dollop of cream, and salt/pepper to taste. Best with fresh simple bread, or a quesedilla would be really tasty too I bet.

Chop the vegetables and the ginger, saute them in some olive oil on low heat until soft and translucent. Add the cloves and cinnamon towards the end. Add the squash and some vegetable stock. Simmer while stirring and mashing the squash. Add the remaining spices and continue adding stock until you reach the desired consistency--but it's gonna be thick.

=== [http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vietnamese-style-vegetarian-curry-soup/ Vietnamese Style Vegetarian Curry Soup] ===
Served by [[User:Jeff|Jeff]] on February 22, 2012.

'''Ingredients'''

*2 tablespoons vegetable oil
*1 onion, coarsely chopped
*2 shallots, thinly sliced
*2 cloves garlic, chopped
*2 inch piece fresh ginger root, thinly sliced
*1 stalk lemon grass, cut into 2 inch pieces
*4 tablespoons curry powder
*1 green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
*2 carrots, peeled and diagonally sliced
*8 mushrooms, sliced
*1 pound fried tofu, cut into bite-size pieces
*4 cups vegetable broth
*4 cups water
*2 tablespoons vegetarian fish sauce (optional)
*2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
*1 bay leaf
*2 kaffir lime leaves
*8 small potatoes, quartered
*1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk

*2 cups fresh bean sprouts, for garnish
*8 sprigs fresh chopped cilantro, for garnish

'''Instructions'''

The above makes about 8 servings.

Heat oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and
shallots until soft and translucent.
Stir in garlic, ginger, lemon grass and curry powder. Cook for about 5
minutes, to release the flavors of the curry.
Stir in green pepper, carrots, mushrooms and tofu.
Pour in vegetable stock and water. Season with fish sauce and red
pepper flakes.
Bring to a boil, then stir in potatoes and coconut milk. When soup
returns to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 40 to 60 minutes, or
until potatoes are tender.

Garnish each bowl with a pile of bean sprouts and cilantro.

I doubled this recipe and made a few small changes.
I couldn't find lemon grass &amp; substituted a bit of my bunch of
cilantro.  I couldn't find kaffir lime leaves and substituted the zest
of one key lime.  I used somewhat larger cans of coconut milk.

I added the bay leaves and lime zest immediately after adding the stock.
I removed the green peppers, and held back the carrots and half of the
mushrooms--actually I used almost twice as many mushrooms as called
for in the (doubled) recipe.  I also added an unmeasured amount of brocoli and green beans
(see next).  

About 15 minutes before it would be ready, add the carrots and 2nd
round of the mushrooms.
About 5 minutes before it would be ready, add the beans and brocoli.
This helps keep the veggies a bit crisp!

=== Sweet Potato Miso Stew with Tofu ===
